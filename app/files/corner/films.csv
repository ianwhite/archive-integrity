While he ponders direct action, his older brother's romantic life proceeds shambolically apace, and just because he's a philosophy tutor doesn't mean he knows how to set things in order. Judged in the harshest light, the film suffers from a certain lack of tension, as McDonald half comically crosses the line of legality and lives to sidestep the consequence. It's also undermined by a niggling lack of resolution to a couple of minor plotpoints, and by its somewhat underdeveloped female characters.

Meenakshi Iyer, who is from a strict orthodox Hindu background, is leaving to Chennai for her husband, with her young child, after the vacation with her parents. By chance, she gets a co-passenger who is also to Chennai, Rajah, a photographer, introduced by one of the friends of her father. During the journey they build a good relationship. But a Hindu-Muslim communal riot sets out in the meantime, in some areas they had to travel. Then she comes to face the fact that Rajah is not a Hindu but a Muslim whose real name is Jehangir. Even though she curses herself at that time while some Hindu fanatics evade their bus she saves him introducing as Mr. Iyer. But they have to reach their destination while the other passengers know Rajah as no one else but Mr. Iyer.",0.330352845154936,/pniCEwUAXdbIifrHg2i11VVq7Td.jpg,7/19/02,,120,,,7,2

It tells the story of Amir, a well-to-do boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul, who is tormented by the guilt of abandoning his friend Hassan, the son of his father's Hazara servant. The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of the monarchy in Afghanistan through the Soviet military intervention, the mass exodus of Afghan refugees to Pakistan and the United States, and the Taliban regime.  Though most of the film is set in Afghanistan, these parts were mostly shot in Kashgar, China, due to the dangers of filming in Afghanistan at the time. Most of the film's dialogue is in Dari, the Afghan dialect of Persian, with the remainder spoken in English.

But whatever did happen to the horse? This film, which is Tarr's last, follows up this question in a fictionalized story of what occurred. The man who whipped the horse is a rural farmer who makes his living taking on carting jobs into the city with his horse-drawn cart. The horse is old and in very poor health, but does its best to obey its master's commands. The farmer and his daughter must come to the understanding that it will be unable to go on sustaining their livelihoods.

This tantalising film-within-a-film serves to both deconstruct and pay affectionate homage to the often-maligned exploitation style.  Having created a full screenplay, score and cut-and-paste prototype for Hiker Meat, Shovlin filmed key sections and a full trailer in an intense shoot in the Lake District in summer 2013. Rough Cut contrasts these re-made sequences with on-set footage and insights into the development of Hiker Meat’s script, soundtrack and design, to create a compelling mash-up of self-referencing processes, behind-the-scenes viewpoints and time-honoured slasher tropes.",0.34401252783,/myXwDOZFB6raSc9YEkO0lpz5nU1.jpg,12/6/13,,90,Released,How do you remake a film that never existed?,0,0
